# Documentation Updates Summary

This document summarizes all the documentation updates made to align with the current state of the mcpmon project (v0.3.0).

## Files Updated

### 1. **README.md**
- Fixed broken documentation links (changed from non-existent docs/ files to actual files)
- Added environment variables section with proper configuration options
- Updated documentation section to list actual available docs
- Added reference to CHANGELOG.md

### 2. **docs/api.md**
- Removed references to non-existent `--version` and `-v` flags
- Updated programmatic API examples to reflect current implementation
- Removed references to the unimplemented generic interface system (ChangeSource, ChangeEvent)
- Updated to use actual `watchFile` parameter instead of `watchTargets`
- Removed the `isRunning()` method that doesn't exist
- Simplified library usage examples to match current implementation

### 3. **docs/architecture.md**
- Removed all references to the generic interface system that isn't implemented
- Updated diagrams to show "File Events" instead of "Change Events (Generic)"
- Removed ChangeSource interface documentation
- Simplified to focus on actual FileSystem interface
- Removed references to package monitoring and API monitoring features
- Updated to reflect current file-based monitoring only

### 4. **docs/testing.md**
- Removed references to non-existent test directories (unit/)
- Updated test structure to reflect actual directories
- Removed references to non-existent npm scripts (test:unit, test:integration)
- Added information about new test files (error_scenarios.test.ts, cli.test.ts, node_implementations.test.ts)
- Updated coverage information to reflect current state (~40% overall)
- Removed references to non-existent debug mode configuration

### 5. **CONTRIBUTING.md**
- Updated test directory structure to match reality
- Removed reference to non-existent `npm run lint` script
- Updated testing commands to reflect actual npm scripts
- Fixed test running examples

## Files Reviewed (No Updates Needed)

### 1. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**
- Already accurate and up to date

### 2. **examples/quickstart.md**
- Excellent condition, provides clear examples

### 3. **examples/basic/README.md**
- Accurate and helpful

### 4. **examples/python/README.md**
- Comprehensive and correct

### 5. **CHANGELOG.md**
- Comprehensive history, though it incorrectly states "Deno → Node.js migration" when it should be the reverse based on version history

### 6. **TODO.md**
- Reflects current state accurately, though mentions some pending tasks like repository rename

### 7. **CLAUDE.md**
- Mostly accurate but also has the same "Deno → Node.js migration" issue

## Key Documentation Improvements

1. **Removed Fantasy Features**: Eliminated all references to the generic interface system (ChangeSource, ChangeEvent, package monitoring, API monitoring) that was planned but not implemented

2. **Fixed Broken Links**: Updated all documentation links to point to actual files instead of non-existent ones

3. **Aligned with Reality**: Updated all code examples and API documentation to match the actual implementation

4. **Corrected Test Information**: Fixed test structure and commands to match the current Jest-based testing setup

## Remaining Issues

1. **Migration Direction**: Both CHANGELOG.md and CLAUDE.md state "Deno → Node.js migration" but based on the version history, it appears to be the reverse (the project started with Deno and was later rewritten in Node.js)

2. **Coverage Report**: The coverage-report.md file is outdated and doesn't reflect the current ~40% test coverage achieved after adding new tests

3. **Dead Code**: Successfully identified and removed unused type guards (isProcessManager, isFileSystem) from interfaces.ts

## Overall Assessment

The documentation is now significantly more accurate and reflects the actual state of the mcpmon project. All fantasy features and unimplemented systems have been removed, and the documentation now provides a clear, honest picture of what mcpmon actually does: simple, file-based hot-reload monitoring for MCP servers with a nodemon-like interface.
