# Documentation Restoration Summary

## Apology and Acknowledgment

I sincerely apologize for incorrectly removing valid documentation about the Generic Interface System and other implemented features. I made the serious error of assuming these features were not implemented without properly verifying their existence in the codebase first.

## What Happened

1. I assumed the Generic Interface System (ChangeSource, ChangeEvent, watchTargets) was not implemented
2. I removed all documentation references to these features across multiple files
3. Upon being corrected, I discovered these features ARE fully implemented in the codebase
4. I have now restored all the incorrectly removed documentation

## Documentation I Incorrectly Modified

### 1. **CLAUDE.md** (Main Project Documentation)
- ❌ Removed: Generic Interface System section
- ❌ Removed: ChangeSource, ChangeEvent, watchTargets references
- ❌ Removed: Future vision about monitoring beyond files
- ✅ Restored: All of the above

### 2. **src/CLAUDE.md**
- ❌ Removed: Generic Interface System (NEW) section
- ❌ Removed: ChangeSource interface documentation
- ❌ Removed: Extended event types (version_update, dependency_change)
- ❌ Removed: Backward compatibility adapter information
- ❌ Removed: Configuration evolution section
- ✅ Restored: All of the above

### 3. **tests/CLAUDE.md**
- ❌ Removed: Generic Interface Testing (NEW) section
- ❌ Removed: References to generic_interfaces.test.ts
- ❌ Removed: Extended event type examples
- ❌ Removed: watchTargets configuration examples
- ✅ Restored: All of the above

### 4. **docs/api.md**
- ❌ Removed: Migration from mcp-hmr section
- ❌ Changed: `entryFile` to `watchFile` incorrectly
- ❌ Removed: Environment variable migration examples
- ✅ Restored: All of the above

## Correctly Updated Files

### 1. **CHANGELOG.md**
- ✅ Fixed outdated GitHub repository URLs (mcp-server-hmr → mcpmon)
- This change was correct and has been kept

## Current State

All documentation has been restored to accurately reflect the implemented features:

1. **Generic Interface System IS implemented** with:
   - `ChangeSource` interface for generic monitoring
   - `ChangeEvent` with extended event types
   - `watchTargets` array configuration
   - Backward compatibility through FileSystem→ChangeSource adapter

2. **The codebase supports**:
   - File monitoring (current)
   - Package monitoring event types (version_update, dependency_change)
   - Extensible architecture for future monitoring sources

3. **Tests exist** for:
   - Generic interface functionality (generic_interfaces.test.ts)
   - Backward compatibility
   - Extended event types

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify implementation before modifying documentation
2. Check the actual code (interfaces.ts, proxy.ts) before assuming features don't exist
3. When in doubt, grep for the specific interfaces/types in the codebase
4. Trust the documentation unless there's clear evidence it's wrong

## Verification

The Generic Interface System can be found in:
- `src/interfaces.ts` - ChangeSource, ChangeEvent, ChangeEventType definitions
- `src/proxy.ts` - Implementation with FileSystem adapter
- `tests/behavior/generic_interfaces.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests
- `dist/` files - Compiled TypeScript showing the interfaces

I apologize again for the confusion and incorrect changes. The documentation is now restored to its correct state.
